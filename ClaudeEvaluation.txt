Overall Analysis
Code Quality Rankings:

Swift-DeepCoder - Best balance of structure, error handling, and implementation
Swift-DeepSeek - Strong UI organization but missing key functionality
Swift-Qwen2.5 - Well-documented but limited functionality
Swift-Full - Good architecture but questionable implementation details
Swift-Granite - Basic placeholder implementation

Performance Rankings:

Swift-Granite - Fastest overall with highest token processing rates
Swift-DeepCoder - Good balance of speed and quality
Swift-Full - Moderate performance
Swift-Qwen2.5 - Slower performance despite large model size
Swift-DeepSeek - Slowest overall

Key Observations:

Model Size vs. Performance: Larger models (32.8B) were generally slower than smaller ones, with Swift-DeepSeek being particularly slow.
Implementation Completeness: None of the models delivered a completely functional pivot table implementation - they all left parts as placeholders or simplified the concept.
Error Handling: Only Swift-DeepCoder and Swift-DeepSeek included proper error handling considerations.
Code Structure: All models used different approaches to structuring the application, with Swift-DeepCoder and Swift-DeepSeek providing the cleanest architecture.
Documentation Quality: Swift-Qwen2.5 had the best code comments and explanations, while Swift-Granite had minimal documentation.

Conclusion
If I were to recommend one model based on this comparison, I would choose Swift-DeepCoder for its balance of code quality, completeness, and performance. It provided a solid foundation that could be extended to implement full pivot table functionality while maintaining good performance characteristics.
For projects where rapid prototyping matters most, Swift-Granite would be the fastest option, though the code would require more development to reach production quality.
