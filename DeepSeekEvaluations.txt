Best Performer: swiftqwen2.5.txt
Demonstrated strongest understanding of SwiftUI architecture and requirements, though all solutions failed to implement actual pivot aggregation logic.

Critical Model Limitations:

All models struggled with core pivot table algorithm implementation
Common CSV complexities (quotes, escapes) were universally unaddressed
Reactive state management was inconsistent
Memory management for large files ignored
Recommendation: None of the responses provide production-ready code, but swiftqwen2.5's answer provides the best foundation for further development. Future improvements should focus on:

Implementing true pivot aggregation (groupBy + aggregate)
Dynamic column handling
Comprehensive CSV parser
Combine-powered data pipeline
